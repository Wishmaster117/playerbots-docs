# Architecture Plan Roadmap

This page tracks the remaining phases and expected outputs.

## Phase 5 — Data & configuration architecture (1 week)

**Deliverable:** a complete mapping of configs & data.

- `playerbots.conf` and key variables
- DB tables used by the module
- Runtime data (caches, flags, transient state)

## Phase 6 — Quick contribution guide (1 week)

**Deliverable:** a "first patch" guide.

1. Where to make a safe small change
2. Where **not** to modify first
3. How to test locally
4. "PR-ready" checklist
